# Decision Document: Long-Term Strategy for the CapAuth ↔ Authentik Integration

**Status:** Proposed (decision pending Chef)
**Date:** 2026-06-22
**Author:** Opus (research + recommendation)
**Scope:** How to maintain the CapAuth PGP passwordless login *inside* Authentik
long-term — upstream PR, fork/custom image, redistributable package, or drop
Authentik in favor of native per-app plugins.

> TL;DR recommendation: **Stop investing in the forked custom image as the
> primary path. Adopt a two-track strategy: (1) make native per-app CapAuth
> plugins the default sovereign login (Nextcloud is already done and works in a
> real browser); (2) keep Authentik integration alive in a *backend-only,
> non-web-patching* form — a custom Django app layered on the stock image with
> NO web-bundle rebuild — and use Authentik's *existing* WebAuthn/passkey or an
> OIDC-source bridge for the browser UI rather than shipping our own Lit
> component.** Only pursue an upstream PR if we first reframe CapAuth as a
> *Source* (external IdP) rather than a built-in *Stage*. See §5.

## 1. What our changes actually are, and why they are fragile

### 1.1 The two artifacts

| Artifact | What it is | Where |
|---|---|---|
| **CapAuth backend stage** | A Django app: `CapAuthStage` model + `CapAuthStageView` (flow-executor `ChallengeStageView`), DRF serializer/viewset, `nonce_store`, `verifier`, `claims_mapper`, plus a `CapAuthKeyRegistry` model that *is* the entire user DB (one row per PGP fingerprint). | `src/capauth/authentik/` |
| **CapAuth web component** | A Lit web component `ak-stage-capauth` (`BaseStage` subclass) that renders the fingerprint→nonce→signed-response UI in the flow executor. | `web/stages/capauth/CapAuthStage.ts` |

These are stitched into Authentik by **`Dockerfile.authentik-capauth`** (cap12 =
current), which:

1. Clones `goauthentik/authentik` at `version/2026.5.3`, `npm ci`s the exact
   pinned deps, copies our component into `web/src/flow/stages/capauth/`,
   **appends an `import` to the internal `src/flow/index.entrypoint.ts`**, and
   runs `npm run build` to recompile Authentik's whole web bundle.
2. Installs the `capauth` Python package + PGPy into the stock server image's
   detected venv site-packages, and **vendors an `imghdr` shim** (PGPy 0.6.0
   `import imghdr`; stdlib-removed in py3.13 per PEP 594; AK 2026.5.x runs
   py3.14).
3. Registers the Django app by dropping `/data/user_settings.py` that puts
   `capauth` into `TENANT_APPS`, and bakes a blueprint creating the stage + flow.

### 1.2 Why it is fragile (the cost of forking — observed, not theoretical)

Every one of these has already bitten us on `.13`:

- **The web bundle must be recompiled from source on every version bump.** There
  is no extension point: `src/flow/index.entrypoint.ts` and the stage-dispatch
  registry are *internal* files. We edit Authentik's own source to register a
  component.
- **The from-source web build is currently broken and shipped DISABLED.** `npm
  run build` hits an esbuild code-splitting bug — a shared chunk defines Lit's
  `createRef` but doesn't re-export it across the chunk boundary → runtime SPA
  throws `does not provide an export named 'createRef'` → blank spinner, SPA
  never boots. Identical under `npm ci` *and* `npm install`, so it is the
  from-source build itself, not version drift. **Net effect: cap9–cap12 ship the
  stock frontend, so the `ak-stage-capauth` component is ABSENT — the PGP login
  form does not render in a browser.** PGP login is only proven via the
  flow-executor API. (Our own blueprint comment says: "For in-browser PGP today,
  use the native nextcloud `capauth` plugin instead.")
- **Python-minor drift across releases.** The venv Python moved 3.13 → 3.14; we
  detect site-packages at build time and vendor an `imghdr` shim because a
  transitive dep (PGPy) relies on a removed stdlib module.
- **Internal flow-state assumptions broke us twice.** `plan.context` in-place
  mutations don't persist across Django session writes (two-step nonce loss);
  `HttpChallengeResponse(...)` requires an explicit `.is_valid()` before `.data`.
  These are undocumented internals that can change between releases.
- **Migration timing.** A custom system-migration ran `ak migrate capauth` too
  early on a fresh DB (`relation authentik_version_history does not exist`); we
  had to fall back to standard `python -m lifecycle.migrate`.

**Bottom line:** the *backend* stage is reasonably robust (it rides documented-ish
flow-executor contracts). The *frontend* is the structural liability: there is no
supported way to add a flow-stage web component without rebuilding Authentik's
bundle, and that rebuild is currently broken. The fork's headline feature
(in-browser PGP login) does not actually ship today.

## 2. Authentik's actual extension capabilities for custom stages

### 2.1 There is no plugin system. This is by design and stated by the founder.

The clearest source is **issue [#1541 "Custom plugin support"](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues/1541)** (closed). The
maintainer/founder **BeryJu** responded directly (verified via GitHub API):

> "A more general answer; in theory it's possible. You can just add a django
> application; **there would have to be some changes made to allow dynamic
> hooking into all the places without having to modify the core.**
> Currently, my opinion is that **any custom applications either make sense to
> merge upstream, or shouldn't be django applications and instead use the API.**"

This is the governing position. It tells us three things:

1. **Custom Django apps are not a supported public extension path.** They "work"
   only because Django + `user_settings.py` lets you bolt one on — but the core
   would need changes for clean dynamic hooking, and those changes don't exist.
   Our `TENANT_APPS` injection is a **hack**, not a sanctioned mechanism.
2. **The sanctioned answers are: merge upstream, or use the API** (i.e. integrate
   from outside via OIDC/SCIM/the REST API rather than living inside the process).
3. There is **no runtime/sideloaded stage loading** roadmap.

### 2.2 No runtime frontend stage registration exists

Authentik's web frontend is a **single compiled bundle** built with esbuild +
wireit across npm workspaces (`@goauthentik/web`, `@goauthentik/core`,
`@goauthentik/web-sfe`), using Lit web components. Stages are dispatched from a
compile-time registry in the flow interface. There is **no documented mechanism
to register a flow-stage web component at runtime or sideload one**; confirmed by
the docs (no plugin/extension API in
[Contributing](https://docs.goauthentik.io/developer-docs/contributing/) or the
[developer docs](https://docs.goauthentik.io/developer-docs/)) and by the
frontend architecture (see the [Web Frontend System](https://deepwiki.com/goauthentik/authentik/2-web-frontend-system)
overview). To add a stage component you **must** modify and rebuild the bundle —
exactly what we do, and exactly what breaks.

### 2.3 What Authentik *does* support as extension points

- **Blueprints** ([docs](https://docs.goauthentik.io/customize/blueprints/)):
  declarative YAML to create/configure stages, flows, providers, brands. This is
  configuration-as-code, **not** a way to add *new stage types* — it can only
  instantiate stage classes that already exist in the running image. (We use it
  correctly to wire the flow once the class is baked in.)
- **The REST API / Terraform**: manage all objects externally. The sanctioned
  "use the API" path.
- **Sources** ([docs](https://docs.goauthentik.io/users-sources/sources/)):
  Authentik can *consume* external identity from OAuth/OIDC/SAML/LDAP/SCIM
  sources. **This is the supported way to plug in a foreign IdP** — and it is the
  one extension point that fits CapAuth without touching Authentik's bundle (see
  §4 Option C and §5).
- **Expression policies / property mappings**: Python snippets evaluated at
  runtime — useful for claims logic, but cannot render a custom login UI or
  implement a challenge/response stage.
- **`AUTHENTIK_*` env + `user_settings.py`**: configuration override hook. It
  loads custom settings (and can append to `TENANT_APPS`), but that is settings
  injection, not a stage-plugin API — and per BeryJu it is not a supported way to
  ship a custom Django app.

**Conclusion for §2:** Authentik has **rich configuration extensibility (blueprints,
API, Terraform) and a supported way to federate external IdPs (Sources), but NO
plugin mechanism for custom flow STAGES, and specifically no way to add a stage
WEB COMPONENT without rebuilding the core bundle.** Our fork exists precisely
because the thing we need doesn't exist.

## 3. Would the CapAuth PGP stage be accepted upstream?

### 3.1 Contribution model

Authentik takes community PRs (code/docs/features) per
[Contributing](https://docs.goauthentik.io/developer-docs/contributing/):
feature-branch PRs, black/Ruff linting, tests expected, status checks must pass.
New built-in stages have historically landed as first-party PRs (e.g. the
WebAuthn/passkey stages). There is no documented CLA in the contributing guide,
but the project is commercially backed (Authentik Security, Inc.) with an
open-core model, so a CLA may be requested in practice.

### 3.2 Precedent and scope fit

- **Passwordless precedent exists and is strong.** Authentik already ships
  WebAuthn/FIDO2/Passkeys ([docs](https://docs.goauthentik.io/add-secure-apps/flows-stages/stages/authenticator_webauthn/))
  with active investment (WebAuthn L3 `hints` added in
  [2026.5](https://docs.goauthentik.io/releases/2026.5/)). So "passwordless
  challenge/response crypto login" is squarely in-scope conceptually.
- **But PGP-as-a-login-factor is niche relative to their direction.** The market
  and the maintainers are converging on **passkeys/WebAuthn** (their MFA blog
  argues phishing-resistant FIDO2 is the future:
  [link](https://goauthentik.io/blog/2025-03-05-mfa-in-authentik/)). A
  PGP-fingerprint primary-login stage — where the fingerprint *is* the user and
  the user table is a key registry — is a sovereign-identity philosophy that does
  not match Authentik's user model (real `User` objects, brands, enterprise RBAC).
- **The custom-stage appetite is unproven.** The open feature request for
  generic custom stages ([#17726](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues/17726))
  sits at `status/reviewing` with no maintainer commitment, and the plugin
  request ([#1541](https://github.com/goauthentik/authentik/issues/1541)) was
  closed pointing people to "upstream or API."

### 3.3 Assessment

**Low-to-moderate probability of acceptance as a built-in *Stage*; higher as a
*Source*.** A PGP-challenge *Stage* asks the maintainers to adopt and maintain a
crypto path (PGPy, nonce store, a parallel key-registry user model) that
duplicates the role of their passkey work and carries an unusual identity model.
Realistically that gets "interesting, but use the API / make it a Source."
Reframing CapAuth as an **OIDC/OAuth Source** (CapAuth service is the IdP,
Authentik consumes it) needs **zero** new built-in stage and uses an extension
point they actively support — that is far more upstream-friendly *and* removes our
web-patching problem entirely. (See §5.)

## 4. Options and tradeoffs

### Option A — Upstream PR to Authentik core (the stage)

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Submit `CapAuthStage` + web component as a built-in stage PR. |
| **Maintenance** | Low *if merged* (they carry it). High *until* merged (rebase against a fast-moving codebase) and merge is uncertain. |
| **Version fragility** | Eliminated if merged (it's in-tree). |
| **Who can use it** | Everyone, out of the box — best reach. |
| **Time cost** | High + unbounded: shape to their conventions, tests, review cycles, likely a CLA, likely rejection or "make it a Source." |
| **SKWorld fit** | Good if accepted (sovereign PGP login becomes mainstream IdP capability). Poor expected value given §3 acceptance odds. |
| **Verdict** | Don't lead with this for the *Stage*. Viable only if reframed as a *Source* (Option C/§5). |

### Option B — Maintain the custom image fork (current state)

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Keep `Dockerfile.authentik-capauth`, rebuild + re-patch per version. |
| **Maintenance** | **High and recurring.** Re-patch internal files, fight the esbuild `createRef` bug, re-`npm ci`, re-verify the component renders, re-handle py-minor/imghdr drift, re-test flow internals — every bump. |
| **Version fragility** | **Worst of all options.** Breaks on web-bundle internals each release; the web build is *currently broken*, so the headline feature (browser PGP form) doesn't ship today. |
| **Who can use it** | Only us (and anyone who pulls our ghcr image and trusts it). |
| **Time cost** | Recurring engineer-days per Authentik release, indefinitely. |
| **SKWorld fit** | Centralized SSO is attractive, but a fork that breaks on every bump and can't render its own UI is a liability, not an asset. |
| **Verdict** | Not sustainable as the primary path. At most keep a **backend-only** variant (no web rebuild) for API/headless use. |

### Option C — Redistributable Authentik integration (no core fork)

Two sub-flavors, both avoiding the web-bundle patch:

**C1 — Backend-only custom Django app, stock frontend.** Ship the `capauth`
Django app as a layer on the *unmodified* official image (the cap9+ reality
already does this), wire it via blueprint, and **don't** ship a web component.
The stage works via the flow-executor API / headless / CLI / extension clients,
not the browser form.

**C2 — CapAuth as an OIDC/OAuth *Source* (recommended sub-flavor).** Run the
existing standalone CapAuth service (`ghcr.io/smilintux/capauth`) as the IdP;
register it in Authentik as an **OAuth/OIDC Source**. The browser does PGP login
*on CapAuth's own page* (which we fully control — no Authentik bundle), then
Authentik federates the identity in. Authentik then fans out SSO to all
downstream apps.

| | C1 (backend Django app) | C2 (OIDC Source) |
|---|---|---|
| **Maintenance** | Medium: app rides flow-executor contracts; no web rebuild. | **Low:** OIDC is a stable, versioned standard; Authentik's Source support is first-class. |
| **Version fragility** | Low-medium: only backend internals, no esbuild. | **Lowest:** OIDC contract is decoupled from Authentik internals. |
| **Browser PGP UI** | ✗ (no component → stock UI can't render PGP). | ✓ (on CapAuth's own login page). |
| **Who can use it** | Anyone running our image layer. | **Anyone running stock Authentik** + our CapAuth service. No custom Authentik image at all. |
| **Time cost** | Low ongoing; medium to build a clean redistributable. | Medium one-time to build the OIDC IdP endpoints in the CapAuth service; then near-zero. |
| **SKWorld fit** | OK as a headless/API capability. | **Excellent:** centralized SSO from one PGP login, sovereign service we own, no fork. |

### Option D — Drop Authentik; native per-app CapAuth plugins

| | |
|---|---|
| **What** | Each app gets a native CapAuth plugin using *that app's* supported extension API. **Nextcloud is done and proven.** |
| **Evidence** | `src/capauth/integrations/nextcloud/` is a complete, idiomatic Nextcloud app: real `IUserBackend` (`lib/User/Backend.php`), `AlternativeLogin/CapAuthLogin.php` ("Sign in with CapAuth" button), challenge/verifier/provisioning/group-sync services, DB migration, nonce-prune background job, registered via `appinfo/info.xml`. It is **passwordless PRIMARY login in a real browser** — the thing the Authentik fork can't currently do. |
| **Maintenance** | Per-app, but each uses *supported* extension points (stable, documented), so far less fragile than patching Authentik's bundle. Cost scales with number of apps. |
| **Version fragility** | Low per app (app APIs are stable contracts). |
| **Who can use it** | Anyone running that app — and it's publishable to the app's marketplace (Nextcloud app store), real reach. |
| **Time cost** | One plugin per target app (Forgejo scaffold exists; others TBD). No central SSO — N integrations for N apps. |
| **SKWorld fit** | **Excellent for sovereignty** (no central dependency, each app fully owned), **weak for scale** (no single login → many apps; re-implement per ecosystem). |

---

## 5. Recommendation

**Adopt a two-track strategy. Retire the web-patching fork as the primary path.**

### Track 1 (now): native per-app plugins are the default sovereign login — Option D

Nextcloud already delivers what the Authentik fork promised: **passwordless PGP
PRIMARY login that renders in a real browser**, via Nextcloud's *supported*
extension points. Make this the canonical CapAuth login experience for our
highest-value apps. It is sovereign, marketplace-publishable, and not fragile.
Prioritize the next 1–2 apps by actual need (Forgejo scaffold already exists).

### Track 2 (next): centralized SSO via CapAuth-as-OIDC-Source — Option C2

For the "one PGP login → many apps" value that only an IdP gives, **do not** keep
fighting Authentik's bundle. Instead:

1. Add OIDC/OAuth2 *provider* endpoints to the standalone CapAuth service
   (authorize/token/userinfo/jwks) so it is a real IdP. The PGP challenge UI
   lives on **CapAuth's own page** — fully ours, zero Authentik web patching.
2. Register CapAuth in **stock** Authentik as an **OAuth/OIDC Source**. Authentik
   then fans SSO out to every downstream app it fronts.
3. This uses an extension point Authentik *actively supports*, runs on the
   **official unmodified image**, and is decoupled from Authentik internals via
   the stable OIDC standard — eliminating the version-bump treadmill.

### What to do with the existing fork: downgrade, don't delete

- **Stop shipping the web-builder stage.** It's already disabled; make that
  permanent. Do not invest more in the esbuild `createRef` fix — there is no
  supported home for a custom stage component, so even a fixed build re-breaks
  next release.
- **Keep the backend Django app (Option C1) only as a headless/API capability**
  if a concrete need exists (CLI/extension/agent flows that hit the flow-executor
  API directly). Otherwise archive it once C2 lands.
- Tag the last fork image clearly as "backend/API-only; no browser PGP form; see
  AUTHENTIK_STRATEGY_DECISION.md."

### Only pursue upstream (Option A) in this specific shape

If we ever want it mainstream, propose CapAuth to Authentik **as a Source / IdP
integration**, not as a built-in challenge *Stage*. That matches BeryJu's stated
"upstream or use the API" position, needs no new web component, and is far more
likely to be accepted. A PGP *Stage* PR is low-EV and should not be our first move.

### Why this is right

- It **removes the only structurally unfixable problem** (no runtime stage-component
  loading → mandatory bundle rebuild → currently broken).
- It **keeps both strategic values**: sovereignty + working browser login (Track 1,
  proven) and centralized SSO from one PGP login (Track 2, on stock Authentik).
- It moves us onto **supported extension points everywhere** (Nextcloud app API;
  Authentik Sources/OIDC) instead of patching internals — slashing
  version-bump fragility.
- It is **honest about what ships today**: the fork's headline feature doesn't
  render in a browser; Nextcloud's does.

---

## 6. Concrete next steps

1. **Decision sign-off (Chef):** approve the two-track strategy; mark the
   web-patching fork as deprecated-for-browser-use.
2. **Track 1:** publish/polish the Nextcloud CapAuth app (it's complete); pick
   the next target app (Forgejo scaffold → finish, or another high-use app).
3. **Track 2 (spike):** add OIDC provider endpoints to the standalone CapAuth
   service; stand up stock Authentik with CapAuth registered as an OAuth/OIDC
   **Source**; prove PGP-login→Authentik-session→downstream-app SSO E2E on `.13`.
   This replaces the cap-image deploy.
4. **Fork housekeeping:** freeze `Dockerfile.authentik-capauth` at backend-only;
   add the "no browser PGP form" banner to `docs/authentik-capauth.md` and the
   blueprint header; stop chasing the esbuild `createRef` bug.
5. **Upstream (optional, later):** open a discussion proposing CapAuth as a
   *Source* integration, not a built-in stage, if/when Track 2 is solid.
